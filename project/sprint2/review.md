## 2. Review:

>During this sprint, the group of four members organized themselves to distribute the work equally. Each member was responsible for the simulation of one building (Buildings 1 to 4), ensuring complete implementation in Packet Tracer.

>Each simulation included the introduction and configuration of routers, switches, PCs, servers, and VoIP phones, ensuring internal communication within each building and its connection to the campus backbone.

>Additionally, each individual simulation was later integrated into a joint simulation, representing the overall campus topology in a cohesive and functional manner.

>All subtasks assigned to each member were fully implemented without any technical issues, reflecting good group organization and a high degree of cooperation.
