## 2. Review:

> During this sprint, the group of four members organized themselves to distribute the work equally. Each member was responsible for the simulation of one building (Buildings 1 to 4), ensuring complete implementation in Packet Tracer.

> All the subtasks assigned to each member were completed without technical issues, except for the firewall task, which presented significant challenges. However, after several attempts and research, we successfully solved it.

> Compared to previous sprints, having one less week to complete the work was a disadvantage for the group, but we still believe we delivered an excellent result.
